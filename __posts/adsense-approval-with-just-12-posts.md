A few days ago, I thought to apply for Google AdSense and I knew for sure that I wouldn't get the approval. I already have another blog that is AdSense approved, but it took 40+ posts to get the approval, and on this blog, there are just 12 posts.

I wanted to send approval just to check what errors my site might be having that I need to resolve. Because if it got disapproved, AdSense nicely mentions the errors that are messing with their guidelines.

But, guess what, I got the approval! I couldn't believe it myself, but when I compared this blog to my previous one, I found many things which are important before applying to AdSense!

It took me almost 8 months to get the AdSense on my previous blog, I applied for it more than 5 times & on the 6th attempt, I got the approval.

When I was looking for the reason, why it took so long, I found many things that I would like to share with you today!

I've created an Ultimate AdSense approval checklist for your blog, this checklist will help you to see whether your site or blog is compatible with AdSense.

## Ultimate AdSense Approval Checklist ✔

### 1\. 100% Original Content -

You guys already know this, Google hates copied content, if you are copying content & expecting to get the AdSense, you'll never. And it's of no use any other ad networks too because Google eventually will penalize your site.

### 2\. Responsive/ Simple Design -

60-75% of the Google searches are made from mobile devices, if your blog is not responsive, not easily navigable, then you've to make sure that your site is responsive, or else Google will not approve your site.

### 3\. Minimum Content -

Google has never disclosed how much minimum content is required for approval. Many got approved with just 3 blog posts. But, it's ideal to have at least 15-30 high-quality posts before sending for approval.

### 4\. Have Consistency -

I've done this mistake couple of times & regretted it, instead of rambling up 30 blog posts in 5 days, write 1 blog post weekly. By doing this Google will know you are consistent in posting and not just spam websites.

### 5\. Empty/Error 404 Pages -

If your site or blog has error pages like 404, or pages with less or no content, remove them. Pages that get 404 add a 301 redirect. Add content to empty pages. Google hates empty and error pages.

### 6\. Optimize Site Speed -

If your site is taking forever to load, then forget about AdSense, no, forget about Google. Slow websites tend to lose their SERP ranking, as the bounce rate gets increased. You can check your site speed at [page insights](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj2q4qpzJHyAhU07XMBHUoqBrwQFjAAegQIAxAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fdevelopers.google.com%2Fspeed%2Fpagespeed%2Finsights%2F&usg=AOvVaw3omb7v0EMme4VaL9TgK7vt), check the potential reasons for your slow speed, and optimize it.

### 7\. Mandatory Pages -

Your blog or website should have About, Contact & Privacy Policy pages, it's mandatory as per the Google AdSense guidelines.

### 8\. Have Complete Ownership -

If you are making your website or blog on free platforms like [wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/), blogger, Wix, etc. then there is a higher chance of you not getting AdSense approval. For increasing your chances, get a Top-Level domain & hosting, like that Google will know this content & website belongs to you.

### 9\. Resolve all Major Errors -

The reason my previous site was not approved sooner, was because of the errors, it had duplicate content and duplicate meta tag errors. If your site also has those errors fix them. You can audit your website on Uber Suggest or any other free site audit platform.

### 10\. Stop Displaying Other Ads -

If you are using any other 3rd party ad networks as sending approval, you'll never get it. Why will Google want to display ads on a site which is already filled up with ads? Stop displaying other low-quality ads when sending approval, especially pop-up ads.

I hope this post was helpful, let me know your views or tips in the comments below! Also, make sure to share this post with your friends who are struggling with the approval process.
