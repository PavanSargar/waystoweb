I know what you might say, this book is pretty old and antique as this book is from 2008. But because this book is based on JavaScript theory, it explores the core of JS, and it's what never going to change in JS.

That's what makes this book timeless. The author has admitted that JavaScript has some bad parts, however in this book he removes those bad parts and shows you the good parts.

And also, how you can use those good parts as an advantage as a developer and as a problem solver.
