Do you want to become a Developer or Programmer & looking for a decent laptop that could handle some heavy programming tasks? Well, don't worry, today only for you I've curated 5 best laptops that you can get as a programmer for under 40,000 Rupees.

Before diving right into the laptops, let's discuss that what minimum specifications are required for a decent performance. Myself being a programmer didn't have a high specification laptop. When I started to learn development I had really average specs,

- I3 7th Gen
- 4GB RAM
- 1TB 5400RPM HDD
- Nvidia 920MX (which doesn't matter)

These were the specs that I started out my programming journey with, but as I moved forward, learned many things, and when I was at the stage that I really needed an upgrade. After some research, I successfully upgraded my RAM to 8GB & instead of HDD changed it to 256GB SSD.

These two upgrades were enough to make my laptop new & superfast. As compared to its specifications it was now a decent laptop, thanks to the SSD.

So, as you can see you don't need a much higher specs laptop while starting out, I3 & Ryzen 3 is more than enough for decent performance.

## My Recommendation -

These all Laptops are more than good if you are looking from a programmer's perspective. But, if I had to purchase a laptop under 40,000 then I would go for **[Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 15.6-inch](https://amzn.to/3zLWQpt)**.

This laptop has everything that a programmer + or an average user or student looks for. I3 10Gen, SSD, Display & Battery life is 9hours which is amazing at this price point.

Surely, RAM might require an upgrade in the future, but you'll slightly notice it thanks to SSD which is 10 times more powerful than an HDD.

You can go for any laptop from these 5, if you are looking for more convenience, then go for 14-inch with SSD, you'll get an amazing notebook experience, also you'll not have any traveling issues.

I hope this post was helpful, if it was make sure to share it with your friends and family who are looking to purchase a laptop!
