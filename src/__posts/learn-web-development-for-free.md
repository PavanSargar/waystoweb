![Top Websites to Learn Web Development For Free](https://ik.imagekit.io/waystoweb/waystoweb/02/Copy-of-for-thumbnail.png?updatedAt=1682356145320)

In the last post, we discussed the [top 4 free courses to learn web development on Youtube,](https://waystoweb.com/web-development-free-courses/ "Top 4 Best Web Development Free Courses") check out if you haven't yet. Also, we discussed the importance of learning web development and how it is dominating in IT sector.

So, today I am going to make things easier for you, I've curated the list of the Top 5 best web platforms where you can learn web development with interactive exercises, online editors, and amazingly structured documentations.

Watching tutorials is also a great way to learn, but if you want to be a better programmer, you should try and get used to documentations. Because there will not be tutorials for each and everything, you have to get your answers on your own and these websites will help you to learn web development more effectively.
