Starting a new blog or website? or already started? Ok, for those who are going to start a new blog or website, please read this post completely, because it will help you a lot.

There's being a small issue with the new bloggers, that their blog or site is not being **indexed** by search engines. But, **what is Indexing?**

It is the process that the search engines crawl our website in search of content and get it visible on their platform. The information we see when we search anything on Google, Bing, or Yahoo is nothing but the information that has been indexed.

This indexation also helps bloggers to rank their site on Google and get organic traffic. So, that's how blogger makes their living.

So, why it's important? Well, what's the point of creating a blog or website, if you don't get the organic reach, isn't it a waste of the business that you want to get online?

So, today in the post, I will show you the methods, tips and tricks to get your new blog indexed on Google super fast!

## First Build, then Create!

Most of the bloggers, who don't have much experience, are just eager to create content and post it with properly architecting their site. You don't have to be a coder or anything, just make your site completely before writing content and posting.

### Things to clear before your first blog post -

- Have proper user-friendly navigation.
- Use background colors where texts are visible, for eg. don't use blue background and black text, have a white background and black text.
- Don't clutter your website with advertisements, or sidebar widgets, have the least of them. As a beginner, you don't need much.
- Make sure your website is fast. Check your website speed on [**Google's page speed insights**](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/). Also, clear all the website errors shown on page insights.
- Set up an SEO plugin like Yoast or Rankmath, update the settings like taxonomies, breadcrumbs, meta tags, alt tags, etc.

If you've completed above tasks, then you are ready to post your first blog post!

## Submitting Sitemap on Search Console

A sitemap is a data or collection of your site or blog's content. When a sitemap is submitted, you don't have to index your posts individually, Google will automatically fetch the sitemap data and index your new posts.

### Steps to submit a Sitemap

- If you've installed an SEO plugin, then check out their documentation or you can access the sitemap URL in your plugin's setting.
- You can check out this article by [**ahref**](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwju4ZrhhbXwAhW9ILcAHRYeDHkQFjAFegQIDRAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Fahrefs.com%2Fblog%2Fhow-to-create-a-sitemap%2F&usg=AOvVaw0TI9PQuShFMVZfw0Pq7tFB), if you are facing any issues with the sitemap.

Your site map URL, should look something like this.

```http
https://www.yourwebsite.com/sitemap-1.xml
```

Copy that URL and paste it into the Google Site Map section just like this.

- This will index all of the posts or content that will be posted on your website. You can re-submit the same sitemap every once in while for faster indexing.
